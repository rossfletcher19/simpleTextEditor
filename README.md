# _SuperSimpleEditor_

#### _A simple text editor I created that will auto save text files. In my work I found myself having to type out longer analytical comments and I was afraid of losing my work at times. I used notepad for a bit but thought this would make a fun project. The main feature is auto saving txt files._

#### By _**Ross Fletcher 2/2020**_

## Features
  * Runs on Windows PC and Mac.
  * Auto saving every minute if changes are detected.
  * A folder titled 'ssef' (super simple editor files) will automatically be created in your documents folder. This is where your folders and text files will be saved.
  * The first line of the TextArea should be formatted as follows for quick file creation and saving. `foldername-filename` and avoid using characters `\ / : * ? < > |` If you edit the `foldername` or `filename` of the first line of the TextArea and let a minute go by, a new folder or file will be created.
